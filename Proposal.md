#**TokenTires**
A blockchain that will act as a tire registry by tracking the life of a tire.
TokenTires is used to track a tire's entire life cycle to help tire producers better track recalls, collect useful data, keep track of warranty miles, etc. 
At each stop along the way, tire distributors, body shops and car dealerships will be required to make an entry on the blockchain, signing off when they received the tire and where it is currently located, its condition as well as the license plate of the vehicle the tire is fitted to.
